Quick Start Guide to crispy
===========================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-12

The following is a quick guide on how to get started with crispy. This will
cover the basic data wrapper and its constituent properties. For a more
in-depth look at the other data wrappers please refer to :ref:`data-wrap-ex`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-22

The first thing to do is to import the default data wrapper ``CRISP``. This is
the base used for alll of the data objects in the package. ``CRISP`` assumes
that your observations are either imaging spectroscopic or imaging
spectropolarimetric (although it'll give its best at any 3D or 4D data) and is
given either as a `FITS file
<https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html>`_, a `zarr file
<https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ or an object dictionary (see
:ref:`utils`).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-28

.. code-block:: default


    from crispy import CRISP
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-31

The only argument we need now to create our data object is the path to the
file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-34

.. code-block:: default


    c_ex = CRISP("example_data/2014/crisp_l2_20140906_152724_6563_r00447.fits")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-38

Our example object ``c_ex`` is now a ``CRISP`` object containing this
observation. We can get details of the following observation doing the
following

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-41

.. code-block:: default


    print(c_ex)

            CRISP Observation
            ------------------
            2014-09-06 16:53:39.174

            Observed: H I 6563
            Centre wavelength [Å]: 6564.58
            Wavelengths sampled: 15
            Pointing [arcsec] (HPLN, HPLT): (-730.032, -313.398)
            Shape: [15, 1398, 1473]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-47

All data objects in crispy can be indexed in a similar manner to `numpy arrays
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html>`_. For example,
our data above is sampled at 15 different wavelengths, say we only wanted to
work with the imaging data from the fourth wavelength then we could create a
new object as such:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-50

.. code-block:: default


    c_sub = c_ex[3] # remember Python indexing starts at 0!








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-55

And this ``c_sub`` object will contain the data for only the fourth wavelength
in our original data. This kind of slicing is useful as the whole object is
sliced rather than just the ``.data`` property allowing us to keep everything
together.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-59

This is also how the plotting methods work, they expect a slice of the object
otherwise an error will be thrown. For example,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-61

.. code-block:: default


    c_sub.intensity_map()
    plt.show()
